# DevWatch

DevWatch is a clean, developer-focused web app inspired by GitHub’s UI. It allows you to follow any public GitHub user and track their recent push/commit activity—without needing to follow them on GitHub.

## Features
- **Follow any public GitHub user** by username
- **Activity feed** showing recent commits (push events) with commit messages, timestamps, and repo names
- **User cards** with avatar, username, and latest activity
- **GitHub-like UI**: neutral color palette, light/dark mode, monospace/sans-serif fonts, card/list views, and responsive design
- **Minimal, developer-centric design**—no images or fancy graphics
- **Optional sign-in** (GitHub OAuth) for saving followed users (coming soon)

## Usage
1. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Enter a GitHub username in the search bar to follow and track their activity.
